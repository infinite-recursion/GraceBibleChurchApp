            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

                1. If you were to die today, are you 100% 
                sure you would go to Heaven?
                <br />
                2. If you were to die today and stood before God, he asked you why I should let you into my  Heaven. What would you say ?
                <br />
                <br />
                You know, you can know! In 1 John 5:13, the Bible says, "These things have I written
                unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life..."
                and here's how you can know. In Romans 3:10 the Bible says, "As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one,"
                and in verse 23, "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." That means I'm a sinner 
                and that means you are a sinner, also. Most people do not realize the seriousness of sin. God 
                is holy and sin separates a sinner from God.
                <br />
                <br />
                This verse shows how serious it is! In Romans 5:12 the Bible says, "wherefore, as by one man sin entered
                 into the world..." This means Adam committed the first sin. "... and death by sin; 
                 and so death passed upon all men, for all have sinned." This word "death" doesn't mean dying 
                 and going to the grave; it means separation from Go. Until our sins are forgiven, we are separated 
                 from God on this earth and will be separated from God forever and ever in a place called Hell. 
                 This is the punishment for our sin.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 But the story doesn't end here! In Romans 6:23 the Bible says, "For the wages of sin is death; but the 
                 gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." The words "Eternal Life" mean more than 
                 living forever. The words "Eternal Life", in the Bible, mean to live forever in Heaven. 
                 Notice, being saved is a gift; it's absolutely free! You can't buy it, work for it, or be good 
                 enough for it. It is free! It would be as if a friend went to the store and purchased you a present 
                 They paid for it, wrapped it, put a bow on it, and brought it to you. They did everything for you; 
                 all you ahve to do is receive it. That is what Jesus did! He left His home in Heaven, came to earth, 
                 died on the cross, shed His blood, and He paid for your sins. He did everything for you; all you 
                 have to do is receive it. And, Romans 5:8 says He did this for us while still sinners. (READ 
                 Romans 5:8). Most people thinkt hey have to stop doing everything bad before God will save them. 
                 But God loves us as sinners and Jesus died for us. When Jesus died for you, He made it possible for you 
                 to have forgivness of sins and eternal life with God. But, just because Jesus died for you that 
                 does not automatically save you. You mush ask Jesus to forgive your sins.
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Now,___ do you admit that you are a sinner (He says, "Yes"). Do you understand that sin 
                 separates you from God? (He says "Yes"). Do you believe Jesus died on the cross for you 
                 (He says "Yes"). Then, this is what you need to do. In Romans 10:9-13 the Bible says 
                 (READ). Now, "whosoever" means you. We could substitute your name there, "if ___" shall 
                 call upon the name of the Lord,___ shall be saved." Do you think God would lie to you? 
                 (He says "No"). then, according to the Bible, if you asked Jesus into your heart right now, 
                 He would save you forever! Wouldn't you like to do this?
                 <br /><br />
                 I want to pray with you before I leave. (Soul-winner prays). If you will trust Jesus 
                 to take you to Heaven when you die, pray this prayer after me:
                 <br />
                 “Dear Jesus/I know I am a sinner/I believe you died for my sins/ and God raised you from the dead/ Forgive me of all my sins;/come into my heart today / and live forever./ Give me a home in Heaven when I die./Help me to obey you./I mean this prayer/with all my heart!”
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 Romans 10:13 says, "For whosover shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Then, 
                 according to the Bible, what is your spiritual condition? (Point at the word "saved"!). 
                 If you were to die today, whre would you go? (He says, "Heaven!")
