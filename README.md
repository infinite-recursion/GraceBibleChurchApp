#Setting up environment for the app:
1. After cloning the repo, follow the instructions here to install Cordova: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cordova/cordova_environment_setup.htm
Cordova is the tool that I am using to be able to use HTML/Javascript/CSS to create an app for Android and iOS. You don't need Cordova in order to see application since
it's just HTML, so you can skip this step for now. Cordova is just what is being used to build the exectuable for Android and iOS.
2. The code for the app (HTML,js,CSS), is in the wwww folder. To view the page, just open up www/index.html in the browser, and you will see the same thing
that I showed in the video. www/css and www/js have the css and javascript for the page. www/index.js has the actual javascript logic. The other javascript and css files are just libraries. 
3. I'm using the Bootstrap library: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/. It provides functionality that makes the UI mobile friendly. The swipe functionality
and the ability to jump straight to a card is from Bootstrap's carousel componenet: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/. They also have functionality for
the "hamburger expandable menu" (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/). I've used Bootstrap many times in the past, it's a very solid library.
